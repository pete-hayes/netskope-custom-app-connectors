# netskope-custom-app-connectors
A collection of Netskope Custom Connectors I've built to explore and demonstrate whatâ€™s possible. Some are just fun experiments, others are demos to show off how flexible the platform can be in detecting SaaS app activity.

3. Go to **Settings > Security Cloud Platform > App Definition > Cloud & Firewall Apps**
4. Click **New App Definition Rule > Cloud App**
5. Click **Import From File > Add to Activity List**
6. Select the activities.json file to import
